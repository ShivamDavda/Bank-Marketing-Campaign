# üìä Bank Marketing Campaign - EDA with Python

This project explores and analyzes the **Portuguese Bank Marketing Dataset**, aiming to uncover patterns in customer responses to a direct marketing campaign.

We perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand how demographic and financial attributes affect the success of a telemarketing campaign, using Python and its popular data visualization libraries.
